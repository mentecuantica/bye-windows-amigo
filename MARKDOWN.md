# Que es markdown and why it's good ?



###  May be cause it's fashion crazy midnight display  ?

# Nope... 

About 3-4 years ago when i saw files mostly on github or in some sources from github or bitbucket - i was kinda scared of again some files, with new extension for me... Just at a glance - .md files contained kinda readme or description info, but with some symbols, though i had no definite meaning for some of symbols (and their semantic influence on text), it was more readable then plain text.

Few years ago i noticed that *README.md* is almost defacto for every repo, and they renders it pretty fancy! 

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown wikipedia article")
> John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004, with significant collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax,[2][3] with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)‚Äù.[4]



Youth of MD, probably is the reason for currently being not standardized or clearly defined what Markdown language should consist of... 
Well it seems this simple markup (and there are advanced markdown versions from various vendors) it's nice having at least a feature to convert .MD
document to valid (X)HTML document attach ur style sheet file (.css) and u good!  
 


I like WYSIWIG idea, i wrote this piece for github within one decent and being **free** for win - [MarkdownPad 2 Free](https://markdownpad.com/ "MarkdownPad 2")
They have a more advance pro version, and still free brother is nice to start. 
Cons are - for it seems a RAM abuser, and being on Windows 10 now, with markdownpad version 2.5 - it required me to fix some a bug, installing the
Awesomium SDK - HTML UI Engine.
