# upd - no more windows-amigo
I use Windows for ages, even being oriented programming orientation, some knowledge of Linux and how things can be cool there. I still Windows junkie, and hope info i share will be worthwhile for at least una persona)


## upd october 2016

Comparing installing Ubuntu 16 with Windows 10 (following time consuming update to new OS with even more intrusive features) - feck off Windows. 

Days spent for finding correct shell, for learning PowerShell , for installing web-dev environment - that's all bullshit (except .NET developers), wanna code web, PHP, Laravel, PostgreSQL, GIT, nginx... Try to distance yourself from Windows, at least at workplace use Linux, terminal VS GUI seems frightening, and yet it provides awesome results. And stuff like APT-GET...you cant beat it, first i discovered Chocolatey on MS, now it seems that Baboon do the deal.

* Its time to move on ) *
